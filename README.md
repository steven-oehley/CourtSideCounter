# What I learnt üë®‚Äçüíª

This project allowed me to make use of HTML, CSS and JS. 
I used JS to add interactivity for keeping score of the basketball games through buttons to update the scores. 
I also used JS to add a dynamic message for whether the the teams were at a draw or if the home or away team were in the lead. 
On save I used JS to dynamically add scores to a table. 
I also used JS to dynamically add or remove classes of an element to either hide or display the game score table. 
Possible project improvements - using a database or the browswers localStorage to keep track of previous games and loading them in if there are any.
